# Cakes Store
It is a landing page for a small store (frontend project without backend server) I created three years ago to apply the concepts of HTML , CSS , bootstrap and vanilla javascript.

## Features
 ### With vaniila javascript I implemented the following CRUD features :

- Users can add items (different sizes - S , M , L - ) to the cart ,prices are calculated accordingly and (IN CART) tag are added to the item in the store.
- Users can remove items from the cart and (In cart ) tags are removed from the respective items in the store.
- Users can increase and decrease the quantity of a specific item in the cart and prices are updated accordingly.
- Users can navigate between different items and categories
- Users can search for a specific item using the search box.
- Users can empty the cart.


## Upcoming

Adding backend server with Node , Express and external DB to allow users to register for the site and pay for the items.
